examine how heartoo and heartpy in heartrate_analysis_python work
heartoo is reimplement in oo for heartpy.
you can refere mds in .claude for information

Next, I want to refactor heartoo to heartsw swift package in same good oo design

you should put implementations and tests all in swift docstring

You should ensure 
1. put your designs for swift in .claude
2. put your swift code in heartsw
3. put test cases in heartsw/tests
4. write scripts in heartsw, we can easily build and run 
5. compare heartsw implementation results against heartpy, 
you should consider saving both heartsw and heartpy results in json
and leaverage result.py in heartoo for comparison.
5. when run python program always source .venv/bin/activate first
