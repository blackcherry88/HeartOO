examine how heartpy in heartrate_analysis_python work, create md
in .claude

Next, I want to refactor it be good OO designs with patterns but keep functionalities
Please consider to use well known design patterns like composite, inheritance, builder etc.

You should ensure 
1. put your designs in .claude
2. put your code in heartoo
3. put test cases in tests 
4. when run python program always source .venv/bin/activate first
5. design in such way, each class/component should have single responsibility
6. main input and output match process in heartpy.heartrate_analysis_python
    ie, we can get wd, m
7. when use test data look at load_exampledata in heartpy, put the results in json files,
, so we can comparing against heartpy.py

8. ensure write a good test cases in pytests in tests folder
9, write good docstring
